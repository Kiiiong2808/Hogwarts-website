                    Astronomy involved observation of the night skies with telescopes, as well as gaining an understanding of the various phenomena that go on in space, such as Lunar phases and Space weather. Known assignments included learning the names of stars, constellations and planets, as well as charting their locations, movements, and environments.
                    <br><Br>It is currently unclear exactly how this subject is relevant to the education of witches and wizards, but according to Satyavati Shah, there is much that can be gleaned from the stars. It was the only field of study at Hogwarts that had a direct equivalent in the Muggle world.
                    <br><br>Astronomy classes took place in the highest level of the Astronomy Tower, the tallest tower in Hogwarts. Required equipment included a telescope.

                    Charms comprised of a very wide range of different spells concerned with giving a target (be it an object or an individual) new and unexpected properties and/or making the target perform certain actions, among other possible effects. 
                    <br><Br>Charms could be some of the most powerful and game-changing spells in existence. Successfully casting a charm required concentration, precise wand movements, and proper pronunciation of the spells incantation. Charms classes were described as notoriously noisy and chaotic, as the lessons were largely practical. Charms was considered a "soft option" by some when picking N.E.W.T.-level classes.
                    <br><br>Charms classes took place in Classroom 2E along the Charms corridor on the third floor, near the Third-floor corridor. Required equipment included a wand and required textbooks included The Standard Book of Spells series and Quintessence: A Quest.

                    </figure>
                    Defence Against the Dark Arts, commonly shortened to D.A.D.A., was the class that taught students how to protect themselves against the Dark Arts, how to use offencive and protective spells, and how to properly handle and deal with dark creatures.
                    <br><br>This subject required students to participate in practical lessons in order to truly learn the subject; if taught only theory based lessons out of books, then it would only hinder them.
                    <br><br>The subject had an extraordinarily high turnover of staff members â€” throughout Harry Potter's time at Hogwarts, no Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher remained at Hogwarts for more than one school year. Dumbledore suggested that Voldemort jinxed the position because his application for it was rejected. After the end of the Second Wizarding War, the jinx on the position was lifted with Voldemort's death.

                    Herbology was the study of magical plants and fungi. Students learned how to properly care for and utilise different plants, as well as about their magical properties and what they were used for. Students were also taught a few spells that were helpful for gardening, such as the Herbivicus Charm.
                    <br><br>The further a student progressed through their education, the more difficult and dangerous the plants became. As such, students were allowed to use profane language loudly if any of the dangerous plants snuck up on them, as a way to warn others, as well as cope with the stress.
                    <br><br>Herbology classes took place in various greenhouses located behind the castle. Required equipment included a wand, a pair of Dragon-hide gloves, Dragon dung fertiliser, earmuffs, and a Watering can, and required textbooks included One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi, Winogrand's Wondrous Water Plants, and Flesh-Eating Trees of the World.

                    </figure>
                    History of Magic was the study of the history of the wizarding world. The lessons in this class were only lectures about significant names, dates and events in wizarding history. Topics had included the Goblin Rebellions, the Witch-hunts, the Giant wars and the origin of the International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy. The class was considered very boring due to Binns' droning voice.
                    <br><br>History classes took place in Classroom 4F on the first-floor. Required textbooks included A History of Magic.

                    </figure>
                    Potions was the exact art and subtle science of creating various liquid mixtures with different magical effects, many of which could not be achieved through spells. It required adding the correct ingredients into the cauldron and stirring the brew in the correct way, both of which had to be done at the right times and at the right temperatures. 
                    <br><br>Students also studied the different ingredients used in potion making and their properties. Potions was considered a difficult class to achieve an O.W.L. in, as only twelve students from Harry Potter's year managed it. The O.W.L written exam was described as "difficult".
                    <br><Br>Potions classes took place in Hogwarts Dungeons. Required equipment included a wand, a Cauldron, a set of Brass scales, a set of Phials (glass or crystal), and required textbooks included Magical Drafts and Potions, One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi, Advanced Potion-Making, and A Collection of Above Three Hundred Receipts in Cookery, Physick, and Surgery.

                </figure>
                    Transfiguration was a very difficult theory-based subject that practised the art of changing the form or appearance of an object, as well as changing it back. 
                    <br><br>It was also possible to change inanimate objects into living creatures and vice versa, as was changing a living creature into another species. Conjuring things out of thin air, making things vanish into thin air, and making things switch places were also elements of transfiguration. Human Transfiguration was considered the most difficult branch of this subject. Transfiguration has been described as "some of the most dangerous magic you will be taught at Hogwarts".
                    <br><br>Transfiguration classes took place in Classroom 1B on the ground-floor, around the Middle Courtyard. Required equipment included a wand and required textbooks included A Beginner's Guide to Transfiguration, Intermediate Transfiguration, and A Guide to Advanced Transfiguration.
