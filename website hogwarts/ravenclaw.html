                Ravenclaw was one of the four Houses of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Its founder was the medieval witch Rowena Ravenclaw. Members of this house were characterised by their wit, learning, and wisdom. The emblematic animal symbol was an eagle, and blue and bronze were its colours. The Head of Ravenclaw was Filius Flitwick, and the House ghost was the Grey Lady, real name Helena Ravenclaw, daughter of Rowena.<br>
                <br>Ravenclaw corresponded roughly to the element of air, and it was for that reason that the House colours were chosen; blue represented the sky and bronze symbolised the eagle feathers respectively, both having much to do with air. The Ravenclaw points hourglass contained blue sapphires.
