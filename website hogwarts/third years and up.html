                    Care of Magical Creatures, also known as Creature Care, and formerly called Beasts class, was a class which instructed students about various magical beasts; about their behaviour and how to properly identify and approach them, as well as how and what to feed them, how to groom them, how to mount and ride them, and how to breed them, as well as the proper way to treat said beasts and how to act around them.
                    <br><br><Br><br>Care of Magical Creatures classes took place outside the castle. Required textbooks included The Monster Book of Monsters and Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.

                    Divination was the art of predicting the future. Various methods were taught, including tea leaves, fire-omens, crystal balls, astrology, and dream interpretation.
                    <br><br>Divination was different from other magical subjects; it required the practitioner to possess a natural aptitude. One could not simply study hard and expect to get better at it, if a witch or wizard lacked any aptitude for divination, then they were doomed to fail no matter how hard they worked.
                    <br><br>Divination was described by Professor McGonagall as "one of the most imprecise branches of magic". Supporters of the subject claimed that it was an inexact science that required innate gifts like the "Inner Eye". Those opposed claimed that the subject was irrelevant and fraudulent.

                    Muggle Studies was a class that taught about how Muggles lived their lives, as well as various Muggle inventions and their use of electricity. It also included Muggle Art and Muggle Music. However, the information came from a wizarding point of view.
                    <br><br>Muggle Studies was considered by some to be a soft option, but others, such as Percy Weasley, thought it was important for magical people to have an understanding of the non-magical community.    
                    <br><br>In the 1997â€“1998 school year, when Voldemort and his Death Eaters took control of the British Ministry of Magic, Muggle Studies was made into a mandatory core class and the curriculum was changed to described Muggles and Muggle-borns as subhuman and worthy of persecution. After Voldemort's final defeat, Muggle Studies returned to its previous arrangement.
