                    Alchemy was a sort of composite subject between Transfiguration, Potions and Muggle Chemistry, the ancient science of Alchemy focused on the study of the composition, structure, and magical properties of natures four basic elements, (fire, earth, air, and water), as well as the transmutation of substances into other forms. The three greatest ambitions of Alchemy were the transmutation of base metals into gold, the discovery of a universal solvent, and the creation of a miracle cure-all remedy that would prolong one's life indefinitely, known as "panacea". A less well known branch of alchemy was Spagyric, or "plant alchemy", which produced herbal medicines using alchemical procedures. Some witches and wizards considered Alchemy to be some of the most difficult magic known to wizardkind.
                    <br><br>The subject was only offered to N.E.W.T. level students, and the class was only held if enough students wanted to study it.

                    Apparition was the magical form of teleportation in the wizarding world that allowed a person to instantly travel from one location to another, though using this ability was notably unpleasant. The class was a twelve-week course starting after the Christmas holidays. Lessons were optional, but only available to students who were seventeen, or who would turn seventeen before the start of the next school year. The course cost 12 Galleons to take.
                    <br><Br>In the wizarding world, performing Apparition required a licence and could only be legally performed by people over seventeen years of age. The reason for the restriction was that Apparition was dangerous if done improperly: insufficient concentration could have led to body parts being left behind in an unfortunate side-effect known as splinching.
                    <br><br>Although magical enchantments on the Hogwarts Castle and its grounds prevented Apparition and Disapparition there, these protections were temporarily relaxed within the Great Hall for short periods to permit students to practise Apparition. Wilkie Twycross, a Ministry of Magic Apparition Instructor, offered lessons in Apparition to sixth-years.
